## Tonbridge Makerspace

Volunteer-led community makerspace in Tonbridge (Kent, UK).

Build projects, get together, collaborate and learn.

- 3D printing and modelling
- Electronics and soldering
- Coding and software (Python, JavaScript, HTML)
- Eco projects and reusing / recycling / repairing
- Electric vehicles and low carbon tech
- Environmental monitoring and sensing
- CNC milling and engraving
- Drones and photography
- Wood and metalworking
- Graphic design
- Anything else you want to make (bring your skills!)

We are inclusive and welcome all sorts of crafts, please contribute your expertise.

Want to build something but don't know how? Or can't justify buying the tools or machines needed?

We share tools and knowledge, and as a group provide inspiration, encouragement and motivation.

Want to start (or finish!) that project you've been meaning to do for ages? Get involved!

Start by coming along to an event (details on TonbridgeMaker.space or meetup.com).
Typically the last Wednesday evening of the month.

Next event: Wed 29th Nov '23 - 7 PM - The Angel Centre
