# About Tonbridge Maker Space

Tonbridge Makerspace is where members come together to make things, meet people, learn, socialise, and collaborate. A place to make your own projects a reality or help others with theirs.

We believe in bringing people together in a space, where they can explore their craft, with like minded makers, and feel safe to explore new ideas and find new interests. 

## What is a Makerspace?

A makerspace is a physical location where people gather to co-create, share resources and knowledge, work on projects, network, and build. They help intermediate and advanced users develop their skills and creativity, particularly inspiring younger generations to engage with the STEM agenda - Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (or STEAM as it is now sometimes becoming referred to, by also including the Arts). Their activity promotes development of high-end technology skills needed for prosperity and social mobility.


## Who are we?

The initiative was first formed in 2022 by the 6 founding members, after discovering that we all shared a common interest in tinkering and a belief that a Makerspace would be an excellent addition to the local area. 

## When do we meet?

Meetings have been organised via [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/tonbridge-maker-space/) and we have alternated between a “maker” meeting at the Angel Centre, Tonbridge, and a “social” meeting two weeks afterwards at Fuggles Beer Cafe. Before organising via meetup, meetings were ad-hoc and mostly social. 

## What is the plan for the future?

Our goal is to find a permanent space, with a wide variety of resources made available to our members.
