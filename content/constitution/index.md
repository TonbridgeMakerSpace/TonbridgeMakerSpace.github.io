# Tonbridge Makerspace Constitution

## Article I: Name and Purpose

1. Section 1: The name of this organisation shall be Tonbridge Makerspace, hereafter referred to as the Makerspace.
1. Section 2: The purpose of the Makerspace is to provide a collaborative environment for individuals to meet, learn, design, build, and share projects, promoting craft, technical, scientific, and artistic skills through social collaboration and education.

## Article II: Membership

1. Section 1: Membership is open to all upon payment of relevant fees, subject to acceptance of Makerspace rules and codes of conduct.

## Article III: Code of Conduct
1. Section 1: All members are expected to exhibit appropriate behaviour. This fundamental rule emphasises civility and respect towards others in all interactions within the Makerspace.
1. Section 2: Appropriate behaviour is a fundamental rule of all social spaces. Being right about an issue does not justify disrespectful behaviour. Even if someone is correct, behaving inappropriately undermines their message and disrupts positive discourse within the community.
1. Section 3: Civility is crucial; being civil means respecting others, even when disagreeing. Members are encouraged to maintain respectful discourse and seek common ground, even in disagreement, fostering collaboration and positive interaction among all members of the Makerspace.
1. Section 4: Discrimination or bullying in ANY form, including but not limited to sexism, ageism, racism, homophobia, anti-trans, or anti-inclusive actions, is NOT acceptable and WILL NOT be tolerated within the Makerspace.

## Article IV: Governance

1. Section 1: The Makerspace is governed by the 6 founding members (GJ,RH,BH,RS,JS,MS), who are largely responsible for establishing, setup, and changes within the Makerspace.
1. Section 2: The founders, who are largely responsible for establishing, setup, and changes within the Makerspace, shall promote and uphold the core principle of design, build, and share. This principle emphasises the encouragement and facilitation of members to design projects, build prototypes or creations, and share their knowledge and experiences with the community.
1. Section 3: The founders shall ensure that the Makerspace provides the necessary resources, tools, and support to enable members to engage in these activities effectively. Additionally, the founders shall oversee the implementation of this principle in all aspects of the Makerspace's operation, fostering a culture of creativity, collaboration, and innovation among its members.

## Article V: Meetings

1. Section 1: Regular meetings of the founders shall be held to ensure transparency and participation in decision-making processes.

## Article VI: Fees

1. Section 1: The fees associated with membership are essential for the operation and sustainability of the Makerspace. While knowledge and techniques may be freely shared among members, access to physical space and tools requires financial support.
1. Section 2: The fees collected enable the Makerspace to cover essential running costs such as rent, utilities, and maintenance expenses.
1. Section 3: Any additional funds generated, beyond covering basic operating expenses, will be allocated towards maintaining existing equipment, replenishing consumables, or acquiring new tools and equipment to enhance the Makerspace's capabilities and resources.

## Article VII: Amendments

1. Section 1: This constitution may be amended by a majority vote of the founders, with due notice given to all members.

## Article VIII: Dissolution

1. Section 1: The Makerspace may be dissolved if deemed necessary by a majority vote of the founders, with any remaining assets transferred to local charities or similar organisations.
