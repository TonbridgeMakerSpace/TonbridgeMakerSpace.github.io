TL;DR We’re looking to build a makerspace in Tonbridge, and we want you to be a part of it.

[I’m interested](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe1nePvaQE6IjHu7WK-H6Jcl0RrVgHoDz9mzlmdrx1hLxkVHw/viewform)

## Building a Space

We've been working for the last couple of years on establishing a makerspace for Tonbridge. Having a physical space where everyone can work, socialise and make things.

At the same time we've been getting to know the community in Tonbridge, making things in various locations around town, and meeting some great like-minded people.

We've found a potential space in Tonbridge and have the opportunity to build the first makerspace, but we need your help.

## Can you Help?

Do you want to be part of the first makerspace in Tonbridge, do you want to have somewhere to tinker, to work on projects, and to meet new people?

Can you help us by becoming a member and contributing to the space, and helping us put it all together?

## Where and When

We're meeting on Wednesday the 24th April at the Angel Centre (7pm in the Vauxhall room) to discuss, and we would love to chat to you about our plans, and how you can be a part of it.

Please let us know if you are interested using the link above, even if you can't make Wednesday night, we want to hear from as many people as possible.
