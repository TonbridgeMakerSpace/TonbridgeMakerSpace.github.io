They help intermediate and advanced users develop their skills and creativity, particularly inspiring younger generations to engage with the STEM agenda - Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (or STEAM as it is now sometimes becoming referred to, by also including the Arts). Their activity promotes development of high-end technology skills needed for prosperity and social mobility.</p><h2 id=who-are-we>Who are we?</h2><p>The initiative was first formed in 2022 by the 6 founding members, after discovering that we all shared a common interest in tinkering and a belief that a Makerspace would be an excellent addition to the local area.</p><h2 id=when-do-we-meet>When do we meet?</h2><p>Meetings have been organised via Meetup.com and we have alternated between a “maker” meeting and a “social” meeting every two weeks. Before organising via meetup, meetings were ad-hoc and mostly social.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://tonbridgemaker.space/>&copy; Tonbridge Makerspace 2024</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
